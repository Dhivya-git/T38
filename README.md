# semantic.py & watch_next.py

*The semantic.py is for the compulsory task 1. It has the examples from the task except 
I have changed finding similarities for three words to a function. I have also added
required notes based on my observations.*

*The watch_next.py is for the compulsory task 2. Movies.txt is used by watch_next.py for
comparing the similarity of the given movie with the movies in movies.txt. It outputs the 
most similar movie to the movie user passes which is 'Planet Hulk' in this case.*
